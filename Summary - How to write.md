# Writing a summary of a fictional / non-fictional text

## Introduction:

-   write an **introductory sentence** which includes: title, author, source, topic, main message

## Main part / body

-   use the **present tense** (simple present and present perfect).
-   use your **own words** (no quotes).
-   write from a **neutral point of view**, i.e. do not include your own opinion / value judgements, etc.
-   **do not create suspense** (you can start with the outcome and then explain / move on to events leading to the outcome).
-   **avoid chronology**, i.e. avoid words like “then”, “after that”, “finally”.

## Conclusion

-   restate the main message or action
-   if the source is a fictional text (e.g. short story), you could answer questions like:

    -   What is the intention of the short story?
    -   Why has the author written the short story?
    -   What does the short story / excerpt show?
